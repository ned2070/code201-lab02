        <h3>A bit of biography</h3>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is Neill. I was born on Liverpool in 1970. I am not
          married and have no childre. I have lived in Liverpool and London and
          I am currently in Liverpool.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have a work background in administration. If you think that is
          boring you are correct, but the worst job I've ever had was packing
          frozen food, which was astonishingly tedious and also quite painful.I
          have some experience in programming but I've been out of it for a
          while.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have a third class degree in physics, for which I am inordinately
          pleased with myself. I'm part of the way through a Master's degree in
          renewable energy, still have to submit the dissertation. I also have a
          postgraduate certification in software technology from the nineties.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'd like to get back into programming and eventually at a more senior
          level than I was previously. I might go self-employed, as I have been
          before, but I'm not wedded to it.
