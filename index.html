        <h3>A bit of biography</h3>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is Neill. I was born on Liverpool in 1970. I am not
          married and have no childre. I have lived in Liverpool and London and
          I am currently in Liverpool.
        </p>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I have a work background in administration. If you think that is
              boring you are correct.
            </li>  
            <li>
              The worst job I've ever had was packing
              frozen food, which was astonishingly tedious and also quite painful.
            </li>
            <li>
              I have some experience in programming but I've been out of it for a
              while.
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I have no GCSEs. That's because I was in the last school cohort to take O levels. That's my excuse and I'm stickng to it.
            </li>
            <li>
              I obtained an A at A level General Studies. Don't pretend your not impressed.
            </li>
            <li>
              I have a third class degree in physics, for which I am inordinately
            pleased with myself.
            </li>
            <li>
              I'm part of the way through a Master's degree in
            renewable energy, still have to submit the dissertation. 
            </li>
            <li>
              I also have a
              postgraduate certification in software technology from the nineties.
            </li>
          </ul>    
        </p>

        <p>
          I'd like to get back into programming and eventually at a more senior
          level than I was previously. I might go self-employed, as I have been
          before, but I'm not wedded to it.
